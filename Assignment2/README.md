## Assignment 2: Regularization and Model Evaluation

This project explores the details of linear regression using non-linear bases, bias-variance trade-off, regularization with cross-validation and the effects of L1 and L2 regularization on loss.
The presented tasks use synthetic datasets and compare relationships between training/validation error and the choice of parameters (such as number of basis functions or regularization strength). We also look at metrics such as bias and variance for each explored parameter.
